USB Bootloader for PIC16F1454/5/9
=================================

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfhlUpleDKA)

This is a minimal, open-source (512-word) USB bootloader for Microchip [PIC16F1454/5/9](http://www.microchip.com/PIC16F1454) microcontrollers. This is a family of low-cost 8-bit devices with a built-in USB serial interface engine.

A PIC programmed with this bootloader presents itself as a [CDC-ACM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_communications_device_class) device ("virtual COM port") allowing it to be used without drivers on certain operating systems. (Mac OS X 10.9+ confirmed)

The bootloader is written entirely in assembly language and uses no Microchip code. It can be assembled with [gputils](http://gputils.sourceforge.net/), which is available via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and many other package managers. A [PICkit 3](http://www.microchip.com/PICkit3) is required to initially flash the bootloader onto the device, but afterwards, application code can be loaded using only a standard USB cable and the provided [Python script](usb16f1prog).

A sample C program and Makefile are included to demonstrate how to write application code that coexists with the bootloader. The code has been tested to work with [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net).

## Read this first!

- This is **experimental** and has barely been tested. A PIC programmed with this bootloader has been confirmed to enumerate and behave correctly under Mac OS X 10.9.5 on a MacBook Pro.
- I don't have a USB protocol analyzer or non-Apple computers to use for testing. You're more than welcome to test the device under Linux or Windows, but I can't provide support for those particular operating systems. Please submit pull requests, send dmesg logs, packet dumps, etc!
- The bootloader implements the absolute minimal amount of the USB and CDC specs required to enumerate and shuffle data back and forth. It is possible that I'm doing things that aren't standards-compliant. Heck, for all I know, your OS might crash when the PIC is connected! You've been warned.

## Features

- Uses the internal oscillator; no crystal or any external components are required.
- Written in very tight assembly language and uses less than 512 words of program memory.
- The bootloader can be used with a bus-powered or self-powered device. An application can specify whether the hardware is bus-powered or self-powered, and its maximum current draw.
- When power is applied or the device is reset, the chip enters bootloader mode if: a) it does not detect application code, or b) if pin RA3 is held low. In bootloader mode, the device attaches to the USB bus, enumerates, and waits in an idle loop for commands.
- Bootloader code and application code are mutually exclusive. The application does not run in bootloader mode, and the device does not attach to the USB bus when running application code. (unless done so by the application firmware)
- Application code is free to use interrupts; the hardware interrupt vector is in bootloader code space, but all interrupts are forwarded to the application when not in bootloader mode.
- Uploading application code is done with a Python script that uses the [pyserial](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net) and [intelhex](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/IntelHex) packages.
- Multiple bootloaded PICs can be attached to the USB bus, as long as each one is programmed with a different serial number. The serial number can be specified when assembling the bootloader.
- A Makefile is provided for developing application code using the SDCC open-source C compiler.

## Limitations

- A PIC16F145x chip of silicon revision **A5 or later** is required due to an issue with writing to program memory on revision A2 parts. The value at address `0x8006` in configuration space should be `0x1005` or later. See the [silicon errata document](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/80000546F.pdf) for more information.
- The bootloader does not support hot-plugging. To reprogram the firmware on a self-powered device, it must be powered off, connected to the host, and then powered on.
- The configuration words are hard-coded in the bootloader. The device is configured as follows:
    - Internal oscillator, no clock divider, PLL enabled, 3x PLL multiplier
    - Fail-Safe Clock Monitor, Internal/External Switchover, clock output and watchdog timer are disabled
    - Power-up timer, stack overflow reset, and brown-out reset are enabled
    - If an application requires a different configuration, the bootloader must be recompiled.
- Applications that wish to use the USB interface cannot (easily) reuse the USB code in the bootloader. I'd like to address this in the future.
- I have not tried to assemble the bootloader or application code with MPLAB, and I can't provide instructions for using MPLAB at this time.

## Prebuilt HEX file

If you don't want to assemble the bootloader yourself (and you really should, since it's easy and it doesn't require gigabytes of Microchip software to build), [here is a prebuilt HEX file.](bootloader.hex) **Note:** the device serial number is hardcoded to `0001`. Your computer may get angry if it's connected to multiple PICs in bootloader mode and they all don't have unique serial numbers.

## Developing application code

[The sample code](sample_app/blink.c) describes the requirements for C programs, and a Makefile is provided for SDCC/gputils.

To upload code, use the [usb16f1prog](usb16f1prog) Python script like so:

```
usb16f1prog -p /dev/cu.usbmodem0001 mycode.hex
```

In this case, `/dev/cu.usbmodem0001` is the device representing the PIC. (It will be named differently on Windows or Linux.) The `-p` option is not required if you store this value in the `USB16F1PROG_PORT` environment variable.

The application entry point is address `0x200`. On interrupt, the bootloader jumps to address `0x204`. A configuration function that returns the device's power requirements must be present at address `0x202`. This can be a single `retlw` instruction, or a `goto` that branches to a `retlw` instruction elsewhere. This works with C code too: in the 14-bit PIC architecture, constant bytes are encoded as `retlw` instructions, so you can literally "call" a constant.

The power configuration is a single byte:

- Bit 0: If set, the device is self-powered. If clear, the device is bus-powered.
- Bits 7-1: Maximum power consumption, specified in 4 mA units. e.g. `0b0011001 (25) = 100 mA`.
